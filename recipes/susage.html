    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This Thanksgiving apple sausage stuffing is fantastic!
         It is very flavorful and fresh-tasting. 
         This recipe will stuff a 10-pound turkey (which serves six) plus extra.
          I replaced the usual pork sausage with much healthier turkey sausage.
         Other dried fruits may also be used in place of cranberries.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 ¾ cups cubed white bread</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups cubed whole wheat bread</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups cubed whole wheat bread</li>

        <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried rosemary</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>1 Golden Delicious apple, cored and chopped</li>
        <li>¾ cup dried cranberries</li>
        <li>⅓ cup minced fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1 cooked turkey liver, finely chopped</li>
        <li>¾ cup turkey stock</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>

        <li>Spread white and whole wheat bread cubes in a single layer on a large baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until evenly toasted, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer toasted bread cubes to a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Cook sausage and onions in a large skillet over medium heat, stirring and breaking up lumps, until evenly browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Add celery, sage, rosemary, and thyme; cook and stir until flavors blend, about 2 minutes./li>

        <li>Allow stuffing to cool completely before loosely stuffing a turkey.</li>
